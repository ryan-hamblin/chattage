  //On the line below create the postData method. This method will add data to the parse backend.
  //The url for the request needs to be 'https://api.parse.com/1/classes/chat'
  //Because we're making a POST request, we need a way to tell parse the data we want to give it, 
    //in your $http call (along with url and method) have a data property which has a value that is equal to another object which a key of text and a value of the message being passed to parse. IE data: {text: yourMessage} 
  //Also, remember that $http returns a promise. So if you return the whole $http call (return $http(...)), you can then use .then in your controller.
  /* IGNORE THE PARAGRAPH BELOW! WE DIDN'T COVER THIS TODAY */
     /*Also, we want to be able to manipulate the data we get back from parse before we pass it back to our controller. The problem is 
     when we're making a request, we don't know when the response will come back. This sound like a perfect use case for a promise. We can 
     create a promise that resolves with the correct data from parse whenever our $http get requests finishes. 
     Because of the way parse sends back their data, let's resolve our promise with data.data.results if you had the original parameter be date like below.
    .then(function(data){
      deferred.resolve(data.data.results)
    })
